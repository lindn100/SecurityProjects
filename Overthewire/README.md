# Overthewire Wargames

I will post my thought process and answers to the wargames posted on http://overthewire.org/wargames/ here.

## Getting Started

I recommend downloading VirtualBox and installing Kali Linux on it. Kali Linux will serve as a linux enivronment with many of the tools needed for these wargames pre-installed.
