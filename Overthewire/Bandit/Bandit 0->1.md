As told by the instructions, ssh into the server on port 2220 using the command:

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

When prompted for a password, enter bandit0 as the passwrod (as given by the instructions).

Next, we are told that the password for the next level is stored in a readme file. To print out the contents of the file, use the command:
```
cat readme
```
The cat command is short for concatenate and it allows us to print the contents of a file. In this case, we see that the password for bandit1 is
```

```
** That's all for this level! **
