# Port Scanner

This is a small project where I wanted to emulate a small version of NMap. I use this tool often to scan for vulnerable targets, so I wanted to implement a basic version myself, so that I could customize it if I wanted something like this in the future. Right now, this small python program pings the target, and once a connection is established, asks the user for for amount of ports they want scanned. It will then return the open ports.
