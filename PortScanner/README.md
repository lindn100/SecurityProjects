# Port Scanner

This is a side project where I wanted to emulate a small version of NMap. I use this tool often to scan for vulnerable targets, so I wanted to implement a basic version myself, so that I could undertand what's going on 'under the hood'. Right now, the ping program pings the target and returns if a connection was established. The portScanner program will take a host as a commandline argument and scan all 65535 ports. It will print all open ports.
